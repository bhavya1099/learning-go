### Scenario 1: Basic Functionality Test with Positive Numbers

Details:
  Description: This test checks the basic functionality of the `countingSort` function to ensure it sorts an array of positive integers correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of integers `[3, 1, 2, 3, 1]`.
  Act: Call the `countingSort` function with the prepared array.
  Assert: Verify that the returned array is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`.
Validation:
  Assertion choice is based on the expected behavior of a counting sort algorithm, which should sort the elements in non-decreasing order. This test is crucial as it validates that the function handles typical input correctly and maintains the integrity of the sort operation.

### Scenario 2: Empty Array

Details:
  Description: Test the function with an empty array to ensure it handles and returns empty inputs correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty integer array `[]`.
  Act: Call the `countingSort` function with the empty array.
  Assert: Verify that the returned array is still `[]`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can gracefully handle edge cases like empty input without errors, which is important for robustness in real-world applications.

### Scenario 3: Array with Identical Elements

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the function can handle an array where all elements are the same and returns the array unchanged but sorted as required by the algorithm.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array `[5, 5, 5, 5]`.
  Act: Call the `countingSort` function with this array.
  Assert: Verify that the output is `[5, 5, 5, 5]`.
Validation:
  This scenario is important to confirm that the algorithm correctly handles and counts frequencies without altering the array content other than sorting it.

### Scenario 4: Large Range of Numbers

Details:
  Description: Test the function's ability to handle a large range of input values, including the maximum integer value the array is likely to contain.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array with a large range `[1, 1000, 500, 250, 750]`.
  Act: Call the `countingSort` function with this array.
  Assert: Verify that the output is `[1, 250, 500, 750, 1000]`.
Validation:
  This test checks if the function efficiently deals with arrays having wide-ranging values by correctly setting up and using the count array. It's important for assessing the algorithm's scalability and performance with varied inputs.

### Scenario 5: Negative Numbers Handling

Details:
  Description: Verify how the function handles an array containing negative numbers, given that the original function seems to assume non-negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array `[-1, -3, -2, -1, -3]`.
  Act: Call the `countingSort` function with this array.
  Assert: Expect an error or specific handling of negative numbers.
Validation:
  This scenario is critical to identify potential limitations or errors in the function when faced with unexpected input types (negative integers). It helps in understanding the function's robustness and error handling capabilities.

### Scenario 6: Large Array Performance

Details:
  Description: Test the sorting efficiency and performance by using a very large array.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large array with thousands of elements.
  Act: Call the `countingSort` function with this large array.
  Assert: Verify that the function completes the sort within a reasonable time and returns a sorted array.
Validation:
  This test is designed to assess the performance and scalability of the counting sort algorithm under heavy loads, which is crucial for applications requiring handling of large datasets efficiently.
